      <h3>Top 3 Things You Should Know About Buckling Up.</h3>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Buckling up is the single most effective thing you can do to protect yourself in a crash. Seat belts are the best defense against impaired, aggressive, and distracted drivers. Being buckled up during a crash helps keep you safe and secure inside your vehicle; being completely ejected from a vehicle is almost always deadly.</li>
        <li>Airbags are designed to work with seat belts, not replace them. You could be thrown into a rapidly opening frontal airbag if you don't wear your seat belt. Such force could injure or even kill you.</li>
        <li>Fit matters. Before buying a new car, check to see that its seat belts are a good fit. Ask your dealer about seat belt adjusters and if you need a roomier belt or contact your vehicle manufacturer to obtain seat belt extenders.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Seatbelt safety for children and pregnant women</h3>
      <p>Children must be secured by either a federally approved child passenger restraint system or a safety belt depending on their height and age.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Children under 2 years old must be secured in a rear-facing child passenger restraint system.</li>
        <li>Children under 8 years old, or who are less than 4 feet 9 inches tall, must be properly secured in a federally-approved child passenger restraint system.</li>
        <li>A child may not ride in the front seat of an airbag-equipped vehicle.</li>
        <li>Pregnant women should wear the lap belt as low as possible under the abdomen, and the shoulder strap should be placed between the breasts and to the side of the abdomen’s bulge.</li>
